# Movie-App
A Movie application that is similar to Netflix. You can rate movies and the app will use an algorithm to try its best to recommend movies that are similar to ones that you rate highly. 

***In the future, will add the movie information into a database (DB2 LUW) and extract information there***

***Possibly also use IBM Change Data Capture to also move the database information to a completely new database to mimic real life scenarios where data can be stored in heterogeneous database environments (will likely use Oracle or DB2 for iSeries)***
